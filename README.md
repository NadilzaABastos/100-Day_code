# 100-Day_code
I needed to learn python for a final college project. (long, long time ago ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£). But now I decide to improve my skills and I'm doing a bootcamp that includes Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. Learn data science, automation, build websites, games and apps, and I'll post my progress here.

OBS:  My first language is Portuguese, so probably some variables and some input are in Portuguese. Sorry about that.
